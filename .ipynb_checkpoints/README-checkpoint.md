# Plotting gene concentrations through qPCR data

The visualization and analysis of data play a central role in modern scientific research. In the context of the master's thesis "Reduction of resistance genes through wastewater treatment," a Jupyter Notebook was utilized for the analysis and visualization of data on gene concentrations quantified through qPCR from wastewater samples.This study focused on the reduction of resistance genes in different wastewater treatment plants using various purification processes. Observing resistance genes in wastewater is significant as it allows for tracking the spread of these genes and initiating elimination measures. Preventing the spread as much as possible is crucial, as it poses a risk to both health and the environment.
